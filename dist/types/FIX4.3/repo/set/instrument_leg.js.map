In the case of the       *\n* InstrumentLeg component block it describes a security used   *\n* in multileg-oriented messages.                               *\n*                                                              *\n* Refer to the Instrument component block comments as this     *\n* component block mirrors Instrument, except for the noted     *\n* fields.                                                      *\n*                                                              *\n* Several multileg-oriented messages specify an Instrument Leg *\n* component block. An instrument can have zero or more         *\n* instrument legs. The fundamental business rule that applies  *\n* to the multileg instrument is that the multileg instrument   *\n* is defined as the combination of instrument legs. The        *\n* multileg instrument must be able to be traded atomically \u0013   *\n* that all instrument legs are traded or none are traded.      *\n*                                                              *\n* The LegRatioQty[623] is used to define the quantity of the   *\n* leg that makes up a single unit of the multleg instrument.   *\n* An option butterfly strategy is made up of three option      *\n* legs.                                                        *\n****************************************************************\n*/\nexport interface IInstrumentLeg {\n}\n"]}
